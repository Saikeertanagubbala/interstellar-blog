# About Us

Interstellar Space Exploration Blog or ISEB started out as a passion project with a group of explorers dedicated to discovering the unknown of our distant galaxies and stars. Our group of close knit friends work in a variety of different fields with fascinating careers such as astronomers and even astronauts.

## Our Mission

Founded in 2004, our mission lies in educating people about the great beyond and sharing the amazing new discoveries we make with the world. We aspire to explore uncharted territories and document our day to day lives as we go along (and what we uncover). 
 
## Our Team

### **Jimmy | Founder**

Jimmy fell in love with the cosmos due to his mom who was an astronaut and taught him all that he knows about the great beyond. He followed in her footsteps to become one too and is the founder of ISEB.

Jasmine, our co-founder fell in love with the solar system in 5th grade when she had to create a model of it to present to her class. She went on to meet Jimmy, her partner in life and they founded ISEB together.
